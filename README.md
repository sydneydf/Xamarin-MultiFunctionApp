# Xamarin-MultiFunctionApp
Xamarin Cross Platform Mobile Application

Work In Progress

1. To Examine the Code, clone the repository to an appropriate folder on your system and then double click the solution file ("MultiFunctionApp.sln") in the root of the project. You would need VS Studio for this to work.

2. Sometime in the future when I've completed all the issues, I may publish this app.
